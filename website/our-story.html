      <p>Located in the shadows of the Verrazano Narrow Bridge and around the block from the Fort Hamilton Army Base, Narrows Coffee Shop has been a fixture for nearly half a century.  A nostalgic feeling can be felt upon entering as three generations of family, including owners Peter and Stella Anagnostakos, their son Jimmy and his children, can all be found working the business every day.  Frequented by locals, passerby's and the military, our establishment has become a second home to many. You may have even seen Narrows Coffee Shop in television shows and movies. Click on the link to see which!</p>
